# Dog-Breed-TensorFlow-Model

üê∂ End-to-end Multi-class Dog Breed Classification

This notebook builds an end to end multi-class image classifier using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub.

1. Problem
Identifying the breed of a dog given an image of a dog.

2. Data
The data I'm using is from Kaggle's dog breed identification competition.

3. Evaluation
The evaluation is a file with prediction probabilities for each dog breed of each test image.

4. Features
Info about the data:

* Dealing with images (unstructured data) so it's probably best to use deep learning/transfer learning
* There are 120 breeds of dogs(this means there are 120 different classes)
* There are around 10,000+ images in the training set(these images have labels)
* There are around 10,000+ images in the test set(these imagas have no labels because we'll want to predict them)
